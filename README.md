# Nubian Wellness Temple
Welcome to the README file for my first milestone project.
This project is to create a website for a fitness centre dedicated to promoting physical activity among black people and other people of colour.

##UX Design

**Strategy** A systematic search of online resources revealed a significant lack of fitness and physical activity resources dedicated to promotion of exercise in black people in western countries. The health brenefits of exercise and physical activities are incontrovertible. This means black people are less likely to obtain these benefits. Apart from the economic factors, there are also numerous social and environmental factors that restrict the engagement of black people in physical activities. The additional factor of weather with reduced sunshine hours especially in winter further impacts on physical activity engagement. The strategy for the project evolved from the folloowing user story. "As a black person, I want a gym/fitness facility that understands my need as a black person so I can become more active and healthy".

**Scope** This project has therefore been initiated to create a website for a fitness that tries to address some of the imbalance with regards to access to opportunity for physical activity. While there is a social responsibility component to the mission statement, the centre needs economic viability for sustainability.
Key objectives of the projects are 1 To provide a supportive environment that will facilitate regular particiopation in exercise and physical activities. 
2. To create brand awareness.
3. To promote healthy lifestyle in people of colour.
4. Act as an advocate for black people to increase access to affordable facilities for exercise and physical activities.

**Structure** :The structure to implement this project will be based on a principle to make desired information and service readily avaialble and to crearte a website that will be both pleasing and engaging for the user.
The website will be easily accessible across various viewing platforms from mobile phones to desktop. In an increasingly mobile world, a mobile first aprroach willbwe undetaken for the design of the website.

**Skeleton** A mock up of the project was initailly stencilled with paper and pen. A couple of different versions were created to enhance my understanding and competence in creating the skeleton/wireframe of the project. This was converted to a low fidelity digital version using Balsamiq wireframe. 

** Surface** With the wireframe now done, I am now progressing to the surface plane to create the website using the knowledge I have acquired from the various lessons and tutorials.
Here is to a Happy coding!

For this project, I have utilised the framework of the example provided during the lesson on the use of boostrap. This is to increase my familiarity with the bootsrap framework and also to explore other functionaliries within the system. I have also used the bootsrap version 4 as used in the module lessons though I am aware that version 5 now exists.
I created an asset folder which holds my image files. The images were mostly obtained from pexels.com 
My project will have a set up with 4 pages set up as follows:
1 A home/landing page that gives the user information about the service. It will also hav the vaigation elements as well as contact information. For a unique product tacking a bespoke population, I feel it is important for the landing page to provide vital information relating to that. The rule of thirds will be implemented in all the pages of the project. 
The set up of the home page with a header and footer section that is common to all the pages of the website. Content variation will be in the middle section of the pages. 
2. An activities page will show case some of the the various activities on offer. On this page, the activities will be presented with an image overlay that turns to text with hover functionality.
